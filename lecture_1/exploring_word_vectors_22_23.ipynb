The term \"embedding\" refers to the fact that we are encoding aspects of a word's meaning in a lower dimensional space.

With this intuition in mind, many \"old school\" approaches to constructing word vectors relied on word counts. Here we elaborate upon one of those strategies, _co-occurrence matrices_ (for more information, see [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/6.pdf) or [here](https://medium.com/data-science-group-iitr/word-embedding-2d05d270b285)).\n"

Thus, our next step is to run _dimensionality reduction_. In particular, we will run _SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)_, which is a kind of generalized _PCA (Principal Components Analysis)_ to select the top $k$ principal components. Here's a visualization of dimensionality reduction with SVD. In this picture our co-occurrence matrix is $A$ with $n$ rows corresponding to $n$ words. We obtain a full matrix decomposition, with the singular values ordered in the diagonal $S$ matrix, and our new, shorter length-$k$ word vectors in $U_k$.\n",

        "**Notes:** If you can barely remember what an eigenvalue is, here's [a slow, friendly introduction to SVD](https://davetang.org/file/Singular_Value_Decomposition_Tutorial.pdf). If you want to learn more thoroughly about PCA or SVD, feel free to check out lectures [7](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l7.pdf), [8](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/s15/l/l8.pdf), and [9](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/l/l9.pdf) of CS168. These course notes provide a great high-level treatment of these general purpose algorithms. Though, for the purpose of this class, you only need to know how to extract the k-dimensional embeddings by utilizing pre-programmed implementations of these algorithms from the numpy, scipy, or sklearn python packages. In practice, it is challenging to apply full SVD to large corpora because of the memory needed to perform PCA or SVD. However, if you only want the top $k$ vector components for relatively small $k$ — known as [Truncated SVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition#Truncated_SVD) — then there are reasonably scalable techniques to compute those iteratively.\n"

        "Polysemes and homonyms are words that have more than one meaning (see this [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysemy) to learn more about the difference between polysemes and homonyms ). Find a word with _at least two different meanings_ such that the top-10 most similar words (according to cosine similarity) contain related words from _both_ meanings. For example, \"leaves\" has both \"go_away\" and \"a_structure_of_a_plant\" meaning in the top 10, and \"scoop\" has both \"handed_waffle_cone\" and \"lowdown\". You will probably need to try several polysemous or homonymic words before you find one.\n",

        "Please state the word you discover and the multiple meanings that occur in the top 10. Why do you think many of the polysemous or homonymic words you tried didn't work (i.e. the top-10 most similar words only contain **one** of the meanings of the words)?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note**: You should use the `wv_from_bin.most_similar(word)` function to get the top 10 similar words.
